# so_userscript-share-questions-as-markdown
A userscript to allow directly sharing a question as a markdown link.

Adds a "Share markdown" button under posts and formats the links as `[<title of post>](<short link to question>)`

[![Button is located at the bottom of the post alongside Share, Edit, and others.][1]][1]

The user ID is stripped from the short link. 

Example link: `[Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/11227809)`
